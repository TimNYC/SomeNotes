*jquery obj vs dom obj
$(this)    this

.eq is jquery obj,
.get or [0] is dom obj

so the conversion of jquery obj and dom obj: add $() to change a dom obj to jquery obj, and use .get(0) or [0] to get a jquery obj

if a obj exist in a html, $(selector).length = 0

jquery obj is always shellow copy but dom obj is singleton

*$(selector).fn()
$.fn()
$.ajax()


proxy and business deligate
the difference: output and process

*trigger

*sso: single sign on
